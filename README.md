Twitter Sentiment Analysis
===================================

The objective of this NLP project is to detect hate speech (racist or sexist) in tweets.

## Dataset

[Here is the link of the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/arkhoshghalb/twitter-sentiment-analysis-hatred-speech?select=train.csv) 

The dataset is composed of 31,956 tweets labeled 1 if they contain hate speech, 0 otherwise. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

## How to run the code

You need to download the following files:
* [tweets.csv](https://github.com/emiliebsl/sentiment_analysis/blob/main/tweets.csv)
* [SentimentAnalysis.R](https://github.com/emiliebsl/sentiment_analysis/blob/main/SentimentAnalysis.R)

Create a repository in which you download both files. Open you R environment and set the working directory to this repository.
Then, you can execute the code and get the same results as in the report.
